# Preston-Angular TodoMVC Example

> HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

> Preston complements AngularJS by providing an easy-to-use backend with the help of libraries like Restangular.
